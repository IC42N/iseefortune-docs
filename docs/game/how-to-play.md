# How to Play

## Step 1 — Connect your wallet
Connect a wallet to place a prediction and receive payouts.

## Step 2 — Predict the next number
Use your intuition and pick a number **before the epoch ends**.

## Step 3 — Wait for the epoch to resolve
When the epoch ends, the winning number is computed and the round resolves.

## Step 4 — Collect winnings
If your intuition was correct, you can claim your payout from your profile. Your share is proportional to your conviction amount.

> **Pro tip:** Fewer players on a number usually means a bigger share if it wins.
