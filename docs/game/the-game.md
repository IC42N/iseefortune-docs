# The Game

At the end of each Solana epoch, a winning number (**0–9**) is computed from finalized on-chain data (slot + blockhash).

Players use intuition to pick a number and choose a **conviction amount** (how much they contribute to the pot). If your number is chosen, the pot is split among winners **proportional to conviction**.
