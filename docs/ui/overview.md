# User interfaces

I See Fortune is accessible through multiple frontends:

- Web app (Next.js)
- Mobile app (Flutter, Solana Mobile)
- CLI (planned)

All interfaces ultimately perform the same core actions:
- view epoch state
- submit predictions
- view resolved results
- verify outcomes
- claim winnings
